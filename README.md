Quick Summary

1. Variables

JavaScript let

let is used to declare block-scoped variables.

Variables declared with let cannot be redeclared in the same scope.

let variables must be declared before use (no hoisting like var).

They are not attached to the global window object.

Preferred over var for modern, cleaner, and safer code
